                    <li>AR can be used to retrieve patient records more quickly. As a result, doctors can obtain the information they require when they require it. During operations, this is especially useful for surgeons.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >A Driving Experience Powered by Augmented Reality</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">By 2025, augmented reality in automobiles is expected to be worth $673 billion. But, what should drivers expect when their vehicles are outfitted with AR technology? To begin with, automakers are investing heavily in AR technology in their new vehicles.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">GPS is the most common application of AR in vehicles.

                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Augmented reality and Gaming Industry</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">The first thing that comes to mind when people think of augmented reality in gaming is Pokemon Go. After all, AR has become a household term since its successful launch in 2016. Furthermore, AR gaming has grown and received the greatest amount of investment.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">To begin, following the release of Google and Apple’s AR kits, developers have continued to create games with AR elements in an attempt to replicate PokemonGo’s success.

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">AR enables your brand to interact with customers by providing them with a “free taste” of the product before they make a purchase. Customers can also use AR to scan products in stores such as dresses, makeup, and shoes before purchasing them.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">AR can also be used to provide information to customers that a brochure or flyer cannot. Scanning the brochure with the app at just the right spot will bring up a video or photo that expands on the information found on the paper.</p>

                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Key Takeaways</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>AR for marketing and advertising enables businesses to better engage their customers. As a result, implementing this on campaigns can result in higher conversions.</li>
                    <li>AR advertising is less expensive than print advertising. Consequently, your investment yields a higher return.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Bringing It All Together</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">It all began with entertainment, with Pokemon Go and Snapchat bringing augmented reality to the forefront. However, the technology underlying these apps has the potential to go beyond mere entertainment.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">AR is a huge part of today’s emerging technology trends.
