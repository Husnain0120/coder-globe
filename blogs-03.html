                <img src="augmented-reality-in-ecommerce003.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-4">
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">Online shopping has gained fame and brought ease to our lives. But we all have experienced a primary concern while shopping online, a full sensory experience of the product  Will this shirt fit me? Will this sofa be comfortable enough? Is it worth buying these shoes? That’s what we are concerned about. Here, the benefits of augmented reality are put to use!</p>
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4"> In conventional shopping methods, we like to try on clothes, touch the fabric to check the quality, and check on the sofa whether it will fit in our lounge or not. That’s where the online shopping experience lags. However, technological gurus saw it as a challenge and developed an augmented reality (AR) as a solution.</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">Technology has steadily made inroads into e-commerce, and retail businesses are seeking new and innovative methods to enhance these aspects and stay competitive.</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">Recent advancements in AR have proved that the scope of augmented reality is not limited to games or science fiction movies only. It has revolutionized the whole tech industry into a full sensory experience-oriented business market. The benefits of augmented reality allow you to experience the products you want to buy without leaving your comfortable couch at home.</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">According to reports, an appalling 78.65% of shoppers abandon their carts before completing a purchase. This shows that retailers need to do a lot more to persuade customers to go ahead with the items in their carts and make the payment</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 "><a href="#">Statista</a> reported a recent survey on the trends that will shape the future of shopping forecast that by 2025, around one-third of shoppers in the United States will have used AR-powered technologies when buying products online.</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 ">Virtual product viewing is possible when shopping online using AR technologies. The study showed that while in countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the expected use of AR was as high as 45 percent, in Europe, this share was much lower.</p> 
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">So, as you know, AR is the new trend in the ecommerce industry. Let’s further explore the application and benefits of augmented reality in the eCommerce industry. This will give you a clear picture of the scope of augmented reality in the industry!</p> 
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Benefits of augmented reality in ecommerce </h1>
                <p class="text-justify px-4 mb-4">Here are a few ar benefits ecommerce businesses can avail themselves of with implementation in their business strategies.</p>
                <h1 class="text-justify px-4 mb-4" >Increase customer engagement rates</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Customers can stay interested in your ecommerce store for longer because of the immersive and sensory AR experience. Your increased sale is closely correlated with higher engagement rates. Several researchers have supported this claim. Customers are more likely to purchase if they spend a long time on an e-commerce site. </p>
                <p class=" text-justify mb-4">Augmented reality is an automated technique to communicate and engage with customers, which increases the likelihood that a brand will succeed.</p>
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >AR benefits in tangible product experience</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">“See It In Your Space” and “Try Before You Buy” The use of ar benefits by internet shoppers is incredibly common. Customers can use “Try Before You Buy” augmented reality capabilities in the beauty and fashion industries to see how the product looks on them in various sizes and colors. AR scope has already expanded to furniture and home décor companies to show buyers how various things will look in their homes. It’s very practical, interesting, and enjoyable!</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Improves customer satisfaction and reduces returns</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Online returns are a significant problem for retailers, according to <a href="#">Statista</a>, as they cause $550 billion in losses. This is a serious issue, although there are numerous justifications for it. The main causes are that the product does not match the image in terms of size, color, form, or even just appearance</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">The benefits of augmented reality in marketing allow Brands to increase customer confidence by making online products “tangible,” which in turn lowers return rates. Sales are increased because customers are more inclined to click “add to cart.” They are less likely to send things back, saving businesses money on shipping, restocking, and repackaging expenses. Both financially and in terms of client happiness, it benefits businesses.</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Personalizes the shopping experience</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">With an augmented reality framework, the purchase experience is enhanced through its interactive nature. Customers feel more like a part of your brand and the product when you give them power over digital aspects in their physical environment. They can click through things most appealing to them and change the features, colors, and sizes. They practically have a floor salesperson at their disposal.</p>
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Creates content for social media</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Practically speaking, augmented reality scope in e-commerce offers a ready-made digital marketing strategy. For instance, you can offer for customers to try your products on rather than trying to entice them with pictures of your products in online advertisements. Once more, it transforms ineffective marketing into something engaging. Additionally, the “fun element” increases the likelihood of social media sharing, turning your consumers into brand ambassadors.</p>
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Brand Awareness</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Due to the inherent interactivity of the AR framework, it is simple for users to become addicted to your website. Additionally, the longer they stay on your e-commerce site, the greater the likelihood that they will buy something! Even if they don’t purchase while they are there, the increased engagement shows that they are more likely to remember you in the future because they have a better relationship with your brand and products</p>
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >How AR works in your e-commerce business</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">E-commerce is a field that is expanding. With the development of digital technology, e-commerce is making buying and selling easier for the average person. With the arrival of augmented reality (AR) products, it is becoming more engaging.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">A majority of the big online retailers, including Alibaba, Amazon, Shopify, Flipkart, and others, have acquired and are integrating augmented reality into their offerings. They are turning their retail points into ar stores. Alibaba began developing services for virtual and augmented reality as part of its e-commerce user experience in 2018.</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Major retailers and customers now favor an augmented reality-enhanced e-commerce experience over a traditional e-commerce one. More engaging shopping experiences are preferred by younger generations. According to studies, 30% of millennial and Gen Z shoppers desire more integration into their online buying experiences.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">To include augmented reality elements, you do not need to redesign the entire website. Your current e-commerce site can be retrofitted into an augmented reality store by an ar app development company.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Keep in mind that Web AR doesn’t require an app! Customers can now access any augmented reality element or experience through your website, so to speak. Within a few weeks, you can have it operational with any additional Try-On capabilities, product launch intros, or other features you desire. Simple augmented reality experiences can engage your audience and help your company, thanks to web AR works.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">To give customers an immersive experience, augmented reality is used in online shopping. This enables customers to interact with products in real time while still being present in their area. Additionally, businesses may use the benefits of augmented reality to engage clients even after they’ve purchased by informing, connecting, and interacting with them.</p>
                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >Brands using AR in eCommerce</h1>
                <p class="mb-4">Augmented reality framework is being used by some of the world’s biggest eCommerce retailers to increase conversions</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-4">With the help of the AR-driven application “See-my-Fit,” developed in partnership with ZeeKit, ASOS successfully encourages natural photography on its models to highlight its products.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">With the help of this method, their product views have climbed by up to 500 each week. It virtually overlays augmented products on models while taking into account the cut, fitting, and sizes of each piece of clothing. Customers will find the functionality to be very easy and entertaining.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">According to new statistics from Shopify on the relationship between augmented reality technology and eCommerce purchases, ads with AR work content generated 94% more discussion rates than those without it.</p>


                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >IKEA</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">The AssembleAR app from IKEA employs augmented reality products to help users unbox and assemble IKEA items. This software is based on the Apple invention of the ARKit AR technology.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">The software mixes in real-world references and three-dimensional animations on top of the paper manual’s original layouts and designs. AssembleAR makes product assembly simple, which significantly raises customer happiness.</p>


                <h1 class=" px-4 mb-4" >LensKart</h1>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">A “3d try-on” is a service that Lenskart, an eyewear retailer, provides to both its online and in-person customers.
