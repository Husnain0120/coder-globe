                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The taxi booking service operates in two different applications set up. There is a driver app and a rider app. In recently developed apps both options are available, you can switch to either rider mode or driver mode.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Apps for booking taxi services are designed to help riders enter all the details about the ride so that drivers can understand the pick-up location, drop-off location, ride type, and more.</p>

                      <h1 class="mb-4">How Does the TOP On-Demand Taxi Service App Work?</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Booking a ride is easy as a piece of cake with an Uber-like taxi services app. Do you want to book a ride? Just follow a simple chain of steps and complete your journey with comfort and ease.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Requesting Taxi Service</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Customers open the taxi service app and go to a ride-booking request option. This is where customers can select car sizes and other sub-categories like AC/Non-AC. Luxury ride options can be availed by customers but at a cost.!</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Notifying the Driver</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Once customers have requested a ride, the taxi apps notify all available drivers on nearby premises. The driver accepts the ride request, and information is exchanged with the rider including acceptance of the ride request by the driver, driver, and his car details.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Details of the Ride</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The current location of the driver is also shared with the rider. The estimated time to reach the pin location is calculated and shared with the rider as per the location of the driver.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">With the mobile app, the rider can also track the entire route from the point of pickup to the destination.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Payment Process</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Upon the ride’s completion, riders must pay the amount due. Taxi apps take different factors into account including the distance traveled and the base fare to estimate the total fare.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">In some apps, the time to reach the destination is also taken into account when calculating fares.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Rating Options</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Riders can rate and review drivers based on their performance on the app. In addition, drivers can rate their experience with customers. Generally, five-star rating options are included in apps. A five-star rating means excellent services provided by the driver.</p>
                     
                     <h1 class="mb-4">On-Demand Taxi App Development Process</h1>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Features of On-Demand taxi Booking App</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The features that are included while developing the solution are what make a taxi service booking app work successfully. The taxi booking app development company assists you in designing the following customer app features to aid in the successful operation of the taxi booking app.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Search for Ride</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The initial and foremost step of a ride-booking operation is to search for a car. Here the rider app will get the request for a ride option after logging into the app successfully.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Using this feature, the rider can search for nearby cars and request the driver to accept the ride. Nearby drivers are notified once a customer request a ride.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Ride Confirmation</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The rider app will get complete details about pick-up time, drop-off time, and the estimated ride cost. The rider can send a request for a ride after going through all details.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The rider can click on ‘confirm ride’ to ask the driver to pick him up from the location.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Ride Arrival Notification</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Once the driver accepts the ride request, the app will display the driver’s information and distance. When the driver arrives at the pick-up location, the app will send an arrival notification to the rider’s smartphone.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">It also includes information such as the driver’s name, picture, car details, and phone number. It is one of the most important aspects to consider during the taxi booking app development process.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Online Payment</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">The taxi booking app development company can assist your app with third-party payment integration options as well as support for allowing passengers to pay for cab services online.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Pay online is an essential feature for allowing passengers to pay using various online methods, especially when the passenger is out of cash or wishes to avoid the cash exchange.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Ride Rating</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Last but not least, the ride-sharing experience is important in determining the driver’s rating. Before boarding the cab, many passengers check the driver’s rating.</p>

                     <h1 class="mb-4">Driver App Features</h1> 
                     <p class="text-justify mb-4 ">Aside from customer app features, driver app features are also important in the operation of a carpooling app like Uber. The following are the features of the driver app:</p>
                     
                     <ul class="ml-5">
